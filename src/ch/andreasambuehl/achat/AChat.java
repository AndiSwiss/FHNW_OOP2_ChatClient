     * This implementation ensures that the application is a singleton; only one
     * per JVM-instance. On client installations this is not necessary (each
     * application runs in its own JVM). However, it can be important on server
     * installations.

     * Why is it important that only one instance run in the JVM? Because our
     * initialized resources are a singleton - if two programs instances were
     * running, they would use (and overwrite) each other's resources!
