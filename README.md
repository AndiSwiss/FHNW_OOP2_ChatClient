# AChat - a chat client by Andreas Amb√ºhl
This is my chat client for the semester project at FHNW in FS2019.


See a short description of the project here (including information about the server-port):
http://javaprojects.ch/chatroom.html

The above mentioned server http://javaprojects.ch also serves as the main chat-server,
which can be used by this chat client

The code for the chat-server is hosted here (GitLab-Repository of our teacher Bradley Richards):

### Name of the app
The name AChat is somehow connected to my first and last name, but "Achat" is also the German name 
of a very beautiful mineral stone (English name: agate), which is sturdy, has nice patterns because of 
rhythmical crystallization. Furthermore, the agate can be found in many different colorful variations.
