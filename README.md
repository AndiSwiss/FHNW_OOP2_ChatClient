### Name of the app
The name AChat is somehow connected to my first and last name, but "Achat" is also the German name 
of a very beautiful mineral stone (English name: agate), which is sturdy, has nice patterns because of 
rhythmical crystallization. Furthermore, the agate can be found in many different colorful variations.
